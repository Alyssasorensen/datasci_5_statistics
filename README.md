## **HHA 507 Homework Assignment 5**

Explore the intricacies of inferential statistics to appreciate its importance in drawing conclusions from data, utilizing statistical tests to extract insights and inform decision-making using data samples.

## Chi-Square Test:
**Hypothesis:**
The use of Acetaminophen is associated more with the male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
There is no significant association between the use of Acetaminophen and male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**
There is a significant association between the use of Acetaminophen and male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

We will perform statistical analysis to test this hypothesis and determine if there's a significant relationship between the use of Acetaminophen and the gender of male individuals for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

Based on the chi-square test, in the first combined overdose, their were 13 females and 20 males associated with Acetaminophen. Therefore, my hypothesis was correct and Acetaminophen is associated more with the male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.  

## T-Test:
**Hypothesis:**
The average total deaths in the age group '0-9' is different from the average total deaths in the age group '80 and older.'

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
There is no significant difference in the average total deaths between the age group '0-9' and the age group '80 and older.'

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**
There is a significant difference in the average total deaths between the age group '0-9' and the age group '80 and older.'

This analysis will help determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average total deaths between the two age groups.

Since the p-value is less than the alpha amount, we reject the null hypothesis, so there is a significant difference in total deaths between the two age groups. 

## **ANOVA:**
**Hypothesis:**
The count varies significantly across different bed types within the hospital. 

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
The average count of patients is the same across all bed types (no significant difference in patient counts among bed types).

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**
The average count of patients is different across at least two bed types (there is a significant difference in patient counts among bed types).

Based on the findings, the null hypothesis was rejected, meaning there is a significant difference in patient counts among bed types.  

## **Regression Analysis:**
**Hypothesis:**
The latitude of a geographic location predicts the number of stroke mortalities
**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
There is no significant relationship between the number of stroke mortalities (dependent variable) and the geographic location's latitude (independent variable).
**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**
There is a significant relationship between the number of stroke mortalities (dependent variable) and the geographic location's latitude (independent variable).

In this hypothesis, we want to test whether the latitude of a geographic location predicts the number of stroke mortalities. We will perform a regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between these variables and determine if it is statistically significant. This analysis will provide insights into whether latitude can be a predictor of stroke mortality rates.
