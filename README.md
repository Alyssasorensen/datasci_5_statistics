## **HHA 507 Homework Assignment 5**

Explore the intricacies of inferential statistics to appreciate its importance in drawing conclusions from data, utilizing statistical tests to extract insights and inform decision-making using data samples.

## Chi-Square Test:
**Hypothesis:**
The use of Acetaminophen is associated more with the male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
There is no significant association between the use of Acetaminophen and male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**
There is a significant association between the use of Acetaminophen and male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

We will perform statistical analysis to test this hypothesis and determine if there's a significant relationship between the use of Acetaminophen and the gender of male individuals for the first combined overdose in the dataset.

Based on the chi-square test, in the first combined overdose, their were 13 females and 20 males associated with Acetaminophen. Therefore, my hypothesis was correct and Acetaminophen is associated more with the male gender for the first combined overdose in the dataset.  

## T-Test:
**Hypothesis:**
The average total deaths in the age group '0-9' is different from the average total deaths in the age group '80 and older.'

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
There is no significant difference in the average total deaths between the age group '0-9' and the age group '80 and older.'

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**
There is a significant difference in the average total deaths between the age group '0-9' and the age group '80 and older.'

This analysis will help determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average total deaths between the two age groups.

Since the p-value is less than the alpha amount, we reject the null hypothesis, so there is a significant difference in total deaths between the two age groups. 

## **ANOVA:**
**Hypothesis:**
The "Total_Bene_Telehealth" (total number of beneficiaries using telehealth) varies significantly across different "Bene_Geo_Desc" (geographic locations). 

**Null Hypothesis (H0):**
The average total beneficiaries using telehealth is the same across all geographic locations.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**
The average total beneficiaries using telehealth differs across at least one pair of geographic locations.


## **Regression Analysis:**
